# Shopee Clone

This repository contains a clone of the [**Shopee**](https://shopee.vn/) e-commerce website interface. The purpose of this project is to practice and enhance my skills in **HTML**, **CSS** by replicating the layout and design of a real-world platform.  

You can visit the **Shopee Clone** project [**here**](https://zybacon.github.io/Shopee-Clone-F8-Learning/).

## Project Overview

The **Shopee Clone** project is a static website that aims to recreate the layout, design, and basic functionality of the Shopee website. This project builds upon previous experience with simpler designs, such as the W3Schools "Band" template and serves as a step forward in complexity and interactivity.

## Technologies Used

-   **HTML**: For creating the structure of the web pages.  
-   **CSS**: For styling the layout, responsiveness, and visual design of the website.  

## Features

-   **Responsive Design**: The layout adjusts for various screen sizes, from desktops to mobile and tablet devices.
-   **Functional Navbar**: A well-organized navigation bar for accessing key sections of the website.  
-   **Dynamic Components**: Use of interactive elements such as hover effects and modals.  
-   **Realistic Layout**: A close approximation of the Shopee platform's design, offering a professional look and feel.
